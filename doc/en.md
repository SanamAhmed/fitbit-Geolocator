# Geolocator

GPS based app to store locations and orientate yourself:
‚úî Add your current position to your locations list.
‚úî Show the distance between you and the target.
‚úî Show the straight direction to the target position.

‚Ñπ How does it work?

- To add a location, you can do it either from the watch or from the settings section (‚öô). If you do it from the watch, it will use your current coordinates and generate the name with them.

Bear in mind that:

- Fitbit devices has no compass, so the orientation is calculated based on your latest GPS movements.
- If your Fitbit device has no built-in GPS, you'll need to have it connected to your smartphone with GPS.
